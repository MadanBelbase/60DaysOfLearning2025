Day 11 of #60DaysOfLearning2025 ðŸš€
On Day 11, I built on my progress by adding a blog controller to handle POST requests to create new blogs. I structured the route, set up request handling in TypeScript, and tested my implementation using Postman. I encountered and solved common backend issues, like improper request body parsing, and improved how the server responds with status codes and messages. Every bug fix added to my confidence and practical understanding of building REST APIs.
