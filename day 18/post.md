Today, I deep-dived into building a full-stack authentication system using React, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. 🧠

🔑 Key Learnings:

Implemented secure user signup and login routes in the backend using express-validator and bcrypt.

Added password hashing in the Mongoose model and created a custom comparePassword method.

Built a responsive React login/signup form with proper error handling and conditional rendering.

Managed auth state using localStorage and used it to conditionally render the navbar (showing username + logout).

Debugged and fixed 400 Bad Request and TypeScript typing issues using structured validation and return types.

🛠️ Stack: React + TypeScript, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Node.js

Every challenge fixed today strengthened my backend logic and React integration skills. Let’s keep building! 💪
