Day 10 of #60DaysOfLearning2025 ðŸš€

On Day 10, I continued working on the TypeScript backend and focused on creating a blog API route. I learned how to define interfaces and models using Mongoose, structure a POST route to handle blog data, and test it using Postman. Debugging errors like req.body being undefined helped me understand the importance of proper middleware and request handling in Express.js. Each test improved my confidence with API development and backend logic!
